IMMERSED FLAT RIBBON KNOTS
JOS´E AYALA, DAVID KIRSZENBLAT, AND JOACHIM HYAM RUBINSTEIN
Abstract. We study the minimum ribbonlength for immersed planar ribbon knots and links.
Our approach is to embed the space of such knots and links into a larger more tractable space
of disk diagrams. When length minimisers in disk diagram space are ribbon, then these solve
the ribbonlength problem. We also provide examples when minimisers in the space of disk
diagrams are not ribbon and state some conjectures. We compute the minimal ribbonlength
of some small knot and link diagrams and certain inﬁnite families of link diagrams. Finally we
present a bound for the number of crossings for a diagram yielding the minimum ribbonlength
of a knot or link amongst all diagrams.
1. Introduction
A ﬂat ribbon knot is an immersion of an annulus into the Euclidean plane such that the
core of the annulus corresponds to an immersed knot diagram. Flat ribbon links then are a
ﬁnite union of ﬂat ribbon knots. We require that the combinatorics of the self-intersections of
the knot or link match that of the associated immersed annulus or annuli. The ribbonlength
problem aims to ﬁnd the minimal ratio between the length of the core to the ribbon width over
all the planar realisations in a knot or link type. We normalise our ribbons so that the ribbon
width is 2 as can be done by a suitable homothety of the plane.
Kauﬀman [7] proposed a model for folded ﬂat ribbon knots whose core is piecewise linear.
He gave conjectures about the ribbonlength of the trefoil and the ﬁgure-eight knot. Currently,
results in the literature provide bounds on the ribbonlength of ﬂat folded ribbons knots for
certain families of torus knots. The ribbonlength problem remains open for general immersed
and folded ribbon knots. A good survey on ﬂat folded ribbon knots can be found in [3]. Denne,
Sullivan and Wrinkle have reported to be working on the same problem considered here [4].
A similar scenario occurs for the ropelength problem, the 3-dimensional analog of the ribbon-
length problem [2, 5, 6, 9]. Minimum ropelength is the smallest ratio between the thickness of
a tubular neighbourhood of a knot or link and its length. In this case, the unknot is minimised
by a round circle and certain chain links are minimised by linked piecewise C2 loops [2].
In this note, we describe a method that in some cases leads to the solution of the ribbonlength
problem for ﬂat immersed ribbon knot and link diagrams, see Fig. 1. Our method ﬁnds the
tightest immersed ﬂat ribbon knot or link diagram satisfying some simple geometric constraints.
These constraints allow us to embed the space of immersed ﬂat ribbon knots and link diagrams
into a larger space of disk diagrams. The latter space has better properties and in particular,
passing to a minimum length is straightforward. Moreover, we can characterise critical points
of length in this larger space as piecewise C2 immersions, formed by concatenations of arcs of
(unit radius) circles and straight line segments.
When a minimum length disk diagram satisﬁes the conditions for being a ribbon knot or
link, this immediately gives us the solution for the ribbonlength problem for such diagrams.
We give examples where this is the case and also where the minimum length disk diagrams are

not ribbon. We compute the minimal ribbonlength of some small knot and link diagrams like
the unknot, trefoil, Hopf link and an inﬁnite family of link diagrams - see Figure 1.
Finally using disk diagrams, we are able to give a bound on the number of crossings in a
diagram of a given knot or link which minimises ribbonlength amongst all diagrams.
2. Immersed ribbon loops
An immersion is a C1 map between manifolds whose Jacobian is injective everywhere. We
consider C1 immersed loops γ : S1 →R2, where the length of the derivative ||γ′|| = 1/ℓand
S1 = [0, 1]/{0 ∼1}, denoting the length of the loop by ℓ. We endow the space of immersed
loops with the C1 metric. A map γ : X →Y is considered either as a function or its image
γ(X) ⊂Y when no confusion occurs.
The medial axis of an embedded planar loop is the locus of the centres of the circles of
maximal radii which are tangent to the loop and are inscribed in the compact region bounded
by the loop [14]. Note that the medial axis is contained in the focal cut locus, i.e the points in
the region bounded by the loop where either the distance function to the loop has zero Jacobian
or is not smooth. This locus consists of either focal conjugate points for the normal map to the
loop (where the normal map has a singular Jacobian) or focal cut points where there are several
equal length minimising normals to the loop. A simple example is an ellipse where the medial
axis or focal cut locus is a closed interval. The end points of this interval are focal conjugate
points and the interior points are focal cut points.
In this paper, we will use an analogous concept of medial axis for an embedded planar open
or closed arc. Note that the key diﬀerence to the case of an embedded loop is that such an
arc does not separate the plane. So we do not restrict attention to one side of the arc. In
particular, the medial axis of an arc is not necessarily connected and there can be components
associated to normals on either side of the arc. So the medial axis for an arc is the locus of
centres of maximal circles touching the arc with interiors disjoint from the arc and is contained
in the focal cut locus of the arc. The medial axis of a closed arc is necessarily closed. Note
we will combine the medial axes of a ﬁnite closed arc cover of an immersed loop, obtaining a
closed set as a result.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Given a C1 immersion γ : S1 →R2, choose I ⊂S1 a suﬃciently small open or
closed interval such that γ(I) is embedded. The separation bound for γ on I is the condition
that for an arbitrary point c on the medial axis of γ restricted to I, ||γ(s) −c|| ≥1, for all
s ∈I.
IMMERSED FLAT RIBBON KNOTS

Deﬁnition 2.2. Given a C1 immersion γ : S1 →R2, the weak separation bound is the
condition that for each point p = γ(s), there are two circles of radius 1 which touch γ at p one
on each side of γ. In other words, the circles pass through p, have a common tangent to γ at p
and locally lie on one side and the other side of γ near p.
Let T(s) and N(s), for s ∈S1, be a continuous choice of unit length tangent and normal
vectors to γ respectively at γ(s). Let LT(s) = ⟨γ(s)+tT(s)⟩and LN(s) = ⟨γ(s)+tN(s)⟩be the
tangent and normal lines passing through γ(s). We deﬁne a continuous map Γ : S1 ×(−1, 1) →
R2, which is an extension of γ, by Γ(s, t) = γ(s) + tN(s). So Γ(s, 0) = γ(s), for s ∈S1.
The notation Γ will be considered either an immersion of an open annulus or its image when
no confusion occurs, assuming that γ satisﬁes the separation bound for a collection of small
intervals covering γ.
Proposition 2.3. Let γ : S1 →R2 be an immersed loop and I ⊂S1 be a closed interval so
that γ(I) is embedded and γ satisﬁes the separation bound for γ on I. If I is suﬃciently small
then Γ(I × (−1, 1)) is embedded.
Proof. Suppose by way of contradiction that Γ(s, t) = Γ(s′, t′), where (s, t) ̸= (s′, t′), s, s′ ∈I
and 0 ≤t, t′ < 1. Firstly, we cannot have t = t′ = 0 since γ(I) is embedded. Next we cannot
have t = t′ ̸= 0 since this would contradict the separation bound. In fact, since I is closed, in
this case we can ﬁnd t = t′ ̸= 0 minimal so that Γ(s, t) = Γ(s′, t) is a point on the medial axis
at a distance at most t < 1 from γ.
So it remains to deal with the case that t ̸= t′. Consider the smallest value of min{t, t′} for
which Γ(s, t) = Γ(s′, t′) for s, s′ ∈I. (We need I closed to ﬁnd such a smallest value). Consider
the angle between the normal lines LN(s), LN(s′) at X = Γ(s, t) = Γ(s′, t′). If the angle is zero
then s = s′ and this is impossible as the normal line is embedded. Since I is chosen as a small
closed interval, the angle between the normal lines will also be small. Now we can perturb X
to ˆX along the bisector of this angle. By continuity, we claim that we can ﬁnd (ˆs, ˆt) near (s, t)
and (ˆs′, ˆt′) near (s′, t′) so that ˆX = Γ(ˆs, ˆt) = Γ(ˆs′, ˆt′) and ˆt < t, ˆt′ < t′.
The claim follows by analysing the distance to the curve γ. Note that as I is small, ˆs, ˆs′
will be between s, s′ in I. The reason is by the weak separation bound, there are two circles
of radius one which touch γ at either of γ(s), γ(t) (see Figure ?). In particular, γ is locally
between these circles near γ(s), γ(t) respectively. Hence if we choose an initial point X lying on
the line segment L joining these two circles and perturb it in the direction of a small angle to
this line, clearly the closest point on γ to the perturbed point will move in the same direction
away from L as the perturbation of X. Hence since we have chosen the perturbation as the
bisector of the angle between the normal lines to γ(s), γ(t), we see that ˆs, ˆs′ will be between
s, s′ in I.
But this contradicts our choice since min{ˆt, ˆt′} < min{t, t′}. So this completes the proof.
□
Deﬁnition 2.4. Assume that γ is an immersed loop satisfying the separation bound for each
of a collection of closed intervals covering S1. The crossing condition is the following re-
quirements:
• γ and Γ have only double points of self-intersection. In particular, γ self-intersects in
isolated double points or double intervals (for the latter, the self-intersections are not
transverse). Also, for any isolated double point p (or double interval J) of γ, there is a
neighbourhood Up (or UJ) so that Γ−1(Up) = D1 ∪D2 (or Γ−1(UJ) = D1 ∪D2), where
D1, D2 are disjoint open disks, see Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.
• The two branches of γ cross at p or J, see Fig. 2.

CENSUS OF BOUNDED CURVATURE PATHS
JEAN D´IAZ AND JOS´E AYALA
Abstract. A bounded curvature path is a continuously diﬀerentiable piece-wise C2 path with
bounded absolute curvature connecting two points in the tangent bundle of a surface. These
paths have been widely considered in computer science and engineering since the bound on cur-
vature models the trajectory of the motion of robots under turning circle constraints. Analyzing
global properties of spaces of bounded curvature paths is not a simple matter since the length
variation between length minimizers of arbitrary close endpoints or directions is in many cases
discontinuous. In this note, we develop a simple technology allowing us to partition the space
of spaces of bounded curvature paths into one-parameter families. These families of spaces are
classiﬁed in terms of the type of connected components their elements have (homotopy classes,
isotopy classes, or isolated points) as we vary a parameter deﬁned in the reals. Consequently,
we answer a question raised by Dubins (Pac J Math 11(2):471481, 1961).
1. Prelude
It is well known that any two plane curves both closed or with diﬀerent endpoints are homo-
topic. Graustein, and Whitney in 1937, independently proved that not any two planar closed
curves are regularly homotopic (homotopic through immersions) [31]. Markov in 1857 consid-
ered several optimization problems relating a bound on curvature with the design of railroads
[22]. But, it was only in 1957 that bounded curvature paths were rigorously introduced by
Dubins when bounded curvature paths of minimal length were ﬁrst characterized [15].
Fix two elements in the tangent bundle of the Euclidean plane (x, X), (y, Y ) ∈TR2. Infor-
mally, a planar bounded curvature path is a C1 and piecewise C2 path starting at x, ﬁnishing
at y; with tangent vectors at these points X and Y respectively, having absolute curvature
bounded by κ = 1
r > 0. Here r is the minimum allowed radius of curvature. The piecewise C2
property comes naturally due to the nature of the length minimizers [15]1.
In 1961 Dubins raised fundamental questions about the topology of the spaces of bounded
curvature paths [16]. “Here we only begin the exploration, raise some questions that we hope
will prove stimulating, and invite others to discover the proofs of the deﬁnite theorems, proofs
that have eluded us” see pp. 471 in [16]. Fifty years later the fundamental questions proposed
by Dubins were answered through the papers [2, 4, 5, 6]. In addition, the classiﬁcation of
the homotopy classes of curves with bounded absolute curvature, having ﬁxed initial and ﬁnal
positions, and variable initial and ﬁnal directions was achieved in [3].
In this note, we develop an elementary framework enabling us to parametrize families of
spaces of bounded curvature paths. These families share similar types of connected components,
being these: isolated points, homotopy, or isotopy classes, see Theorem 8.5 and Deﬁnition 8.4.
In particular, we answer a question raised by Dubins in 1961 [16] by explicitly describing the
set of endpoints (x, X), (y, Y ) ∈TR2 so that the space of bounded curvature paths starting at
x, ﬁnishing at y; with tangent vectors at these points X and Y respectively admits a bounded
isotopy class, see Theorem 8.6 and Corollary 8.7.
We conclude by presenting an updated
(parametric) version of the classiﬁcation theorem for homotopy classes of bounded curvature
paths in [6], by incorporating the results here obtained, see Theorem 9.1. Our results can be
extended without much eﬀort for paths in the hyperbolic 2-space.
1Dubins proved that bounded curvature paths of minimal length are concatenations of two arcs of a circle
with a line segment in between, or three arcs of a circle, or any subset of these. The so-called csc-ccc paths.

JEAN D´IAZ AND JOS´E AYALA
This article is the culmination of a program devoted to classify the homotopy classes of
bounded curvature paths [5, 6], and the minimal length elements in homotopy classes [2, 4].
We recommend the reader from time to time refer to our previous work [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. We
conclude by presenting an Appendix that can be read independently. This Appendix considers
further examples and questions about computational aspects of connected components, and
deformations of piecewise constant bounded curvature paths.
There is a vast literature on bounded curvature paths from the theoretical computer science
point of view. We encourage the reader to refer to [1, 7, 9, 11, 18, 19, 12, 25, 27]. Bounded
curvature paths have been applied to many real-life problems since a bound on curvature models
the trajectory of the motion of wheeled vehicles, and drones also called unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAV). We mention only [10, 13, 17, 21, 23, 28, 30]. Literature on the topology and geometry
of spaces of bounded curvature paths can be found in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 15, 16, 24, 26, 29].
The illustrations here presented have been imported from Dubins Explorer, a software for
bounded curvature paths [14].
2. On spaces of bounded curvature paths
For the convenience of the reader, we include relevant material from our previous work in
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Denote by TR2 the tangent bundle of R2. Recall that the elements in TR2 are
pairs (x, X) denoted here for short by x. The ﬁrst coordinate of such a pair corresponds to a
point in R2 and the second to a tangent vector to R2 at x.
Deﬁnition 2.1. Given (x, X), (y, Y ) ∈TR2, a path γ : [0, s] →R2 connecting these points is
a bounded curvature path if:
• γ is C1 and piecewise C2;
• γ is parametrized by arc length (i.e ||γ′(t)|| = 1 for all t ∈[0, s]);
• γ(0) = x, γ′(0) = X; γ(s) = y, γ′(s) = Y ;
• ||γ′′(t)|| ≤κ, for all t ∈[0, s] when deﬁned, κ > 0 a constant.
The ﬁrst item means that a bounded curvature path has continuous ﬁrst derivative and
piecewise continuous second derivative. Minimal length elements in spaces of paths satisfying
the last three items in Deﬁnition 2.1 are in fact C1 and piecewise C2. For the third item,
without loss of generality, we extend the domain of γ to (−ϵ, s + ϵ) for ϵ > 0. Sometimes
we describe the third item as the endpoint condition. The fourth item means that bounded
curvature paths have absolute curvature bounded above by a positive constant. Without loss
of generality, we consider κ = 1.
The unit tangent bundle UTR2 is equipped with a natural projection p : UTR2 →R2. Note
that p−1(y) is S1 for all y ∈R2. The space of endpoints is a circle bundle over R2.
Remark 2.2. (Coordinate system and angle orientation).
• For the given (x, X), (y, Y ) ∈TR2 in Deﬁnition 2.1 we consider a coordinate system so
that the origin is identiﬁed with x, and X with the ﬁrst canonical vector in the standard
basis {X = e1, e2} for R2.
• When measuring angles we consider the positive orientation to be traveled counterclock-
wise.
Dubins [15] proved that the length minimizer bounded curvature paths are necessarily a
concatenation of an arc of a unit radius circle, followed by a line segment, followed by an arc
of a unit radius circle, the so-called csc paths. Or, a concatenation of three arcs of unit radius
circles, the so-called ccc paths. After considering r be a circle traveled to the right and l a
circle travelled to the left we obtain six possible types of paths, namely lsl, rsr, lsr, rsl,
lrl and rlr. Paths having one of these types are here called Dubins paths. Note that we are
considering Dubins path to be local not necessarily global minimum of length.
In the following paragraphs, we illustrate through examples the richness of the theory of
bounded curvature paths. Its features come from the constraints these curves satisfy. These

constraints lead to interesting interactions between metric geometry and computational math-
ematics.
Example 2.3.
(1) Recall that length minimizers are considered for establishing distance between points in
a manifold. This approach is not suitable when considering bounded curvature paths,
since in many cases, the length variation between length minimizers of arbitrarily close
endpoints or directions is discontinuous.
Consider (x, X), (y, Yθ) ∈TR2, θ ∈R, with κ = 1:
• x = (0, 0); X = e2πi ∈TxR2.
• y = (1, 1); Yθ = eθi ∈TyR2.
Discontinuities for the length of the length minimizers happen when perturbing around
Y π
2 , see Fig. 1. The sudden jumps in length suggest the existence of isolated points, see
Theorem 3.9 in [5]. In fact, the path in Fig. 1 left is an isolated point in the space of
bounded curvature paths from (x, X) to (y, Y π
2 ).
The path in Fig. 1 right illustrates a discontinuity after perturbing the ﬁnal location
to y′ = (1−ϵ, 1−ϵ) for ϵ > 0 small. Note that length minimisers may not be embedded
paths.
Figure 1. Examples of length minimizers in their respective path space. The
three paths at the right are the result of small perturbations to the ﬁnal position
or direction of (y, Y π
2 ), for ϵ > 0. After applying Dubins’ characterization for
the length minimizers [15] a simple numerical experiment shows the existence of
length discontinuities.
(2) Spaces of bounded curvature paths have several local minima of length, see Fig. 2.
Consider x = (x, X), y = (y, Y ) ∈TR2 with κ = 1:
• x = (0, 0); X = e2πi ∈TxR2.
• y = (−2, 1); Y = e−π
4 i ∈TyR2.
By recursively applying the methods in [4] for obtaining the csc-ccc charactarization
for the length minimizers [2, 4, 8, 15, 20] we obtain all the local minima of length.
By Proposition 4.4 in [6] the paths γ0 and γ5 are homotopic without violating the
curvature bound throughout the deformation. The same applies for γ1 and γ4. By
Proposition 4.3 in [6] the paths γ2 and γ3 lie in the same homotopy class of bounded
curvature paths.
(3) Another interesting feature is that the symmetry property metrics satisfy is in general
violated. For example, the length minimizer from (x, X) to (y, Y π
2 ) has lenght π
4, see
Fig. 1 left. On the other hand, the length minimizer from (y, Y π
2 ) to (x, X) has length
3π
4 , see Theorem 4.6 in [2].
(4) The classiﬁcation of the homotopy classes of bounded curvature paths was obtained
in [6]. A crucial step was to prove that for certain (x, X), (y, Y ) ∈TR2 there exists

Per´ımetros extremos en empaquetamientos de discos
congruentes
Fabi´an Henry Vilaxa
19 de diciembre de 2025
Resumen
Mi investigaci´on est´a enmarcada en el problema del per´ımetro minimo de la en-
volvente convexa de empaquetamientos de discos congruentes. Concretamente, busco
resolver el siguiente problema: Dado un grafo de contacto conexo de discos congruentes
en el plano, determinar si dicho grafo constituye un punto cr´ıtico del per´ımetro de la
envolvente convexa de su clase de contacto. De ser as´ı, indicar si corresponde a un
m´ınimo o m´aximo. En este documento describo y fundamento los elementos esencia-
les del procedimiento basado en el c´alculo variacional que propongo para resolver este
problema.
1.
El problema del per´ımetro de la envolvente convexa
El problema central que motiva esta investigaci´on es bastante visual. Supongamos que
tenemos un mont´on de discos del mismo radio sobre una mesa y les ponemos una banda
el´astica alrededor. Lo que nos interesa es encontrar la disposici´on (o configuraci´on) de estos
discos que hace que esa banda el´astica tenga la menor longitud posible. Es decir, buscamos
minimizar el per´ımetro de la envolvente convexa de los discos.
En lugar de intentar buscar la mejor configuraci´on entre las infinitas posibilidades (lo
cual es computacionalmente infactible), nos enfocamos en un problema distinto, pero en la
misma l´ınea.
No buscaremos el m´ınimo global directamente. En su lugar, tomaremos un grafo de con-
tacto espec´ıfico (una ”forma”de conectar los discos) y utilizaremos herramientas de c´alculo
variacional para responder dos preguntas fundamentales sobre ´el:
1. Criticidad: Si posicionamos los discos de una forma espec´ıfica, ¿Ser´a que esa dispoci´on
entrega un punto cr´ıtico del per´ımetro? (Primera Variaci´on).
2. Estabilidad: Si es as´ı, ¿Qu´e clase de estabilidad tiene ese punto cr´ıtico? (Segunda
Variaci´on).
1
2.
Preliminares
2.1.
Representaci´on de empaquetamientos
Los empaquetamientos los representamos mediante grafos de contacto. Definimos a un
grafo como una estructura G que tiene aristas E y vertices V . Por ejemplo, el siguiente grafo
tiene vertices V = {v1, v2, v3} y aristas E = {(v1, v2), (v2, v3), (v3, v1)}.
v1
v2
v3
En un grafo de contacto, los vertices se “expanden” de manera que cada uno se transforme
en un disco. En nuestro caso, concretamente en un disco de radio 1. En cuanto a las aristas del
grafo, se representan como un “contacto” entre dos discos, es decir, los discos que representan
los vertices conectados por una arista son tangentes entre s´ı.
c1
c2
c3
Para nuestra investigacion, cada realizaci´on de uno de estos grafos en el plano le llamamos
configuraci´on, y la representamos mediante un vector c de R2n, donde n es el n´umero de
discos en la configuraci´on.
c = (c1, c2, ..., cn) ∈R2n.
(1)
Entonces, si tenemos 3 discos, la configuraci´on se representa como un vector
c = (c1, c2, c3),
donde cada ci representa un par ordenado (xi, yi) que indica la posici´on del centro del
disco ci en el plano. En forma expandida:
c = (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3).
2
2.2.
Espacio de Configuraciones
¿Con qu´e configuraciones exactamente estamos trabajando? ¿Que propiedades tienen?
En primer lugar, nuestras configuraciones:
Son conexas: el grafo de contacto asociado a la configuraci´on es conexo.
Son no superpuestas: ning´un par de discos se intersecta
Que el grafo sea conexo significa que no puede existir un vertice o conjunto de vertices
“aislados”, o que no est´e conectado al resto del grafo. Dicho de otra forma, todos los discos
deben tener al menos un contacto con otro disco.
Debido a que estamos trabajando con empaquetamientos, no tiene sentido considerar que
nuestros grafos puedan tener discos que se intersecten entre s´ı, por lo que nuestra restricci´on
principal es que todo centro del grafo debe estar a una distancia minima de 2. Es decir, la
distancia del disco cj y ci debe ser ≥2, o = 2 si existe contacto entre cj y ci.
As´ı, todas las configuraciones “admisibles” pueden definirse como un conjunto de grafos
conexos dado por:
Dn = {c ∈R2n | ||ci −cj|| ≥2, ∀i ̸= j}
(2)
En esta definici´on, ||ci −cj|| denota la distancia euclidiana entre los centros de los discos
ci y cj, y Dn es el espacio de configuraciones de n discos congruentes en el plano.
Podemos descomponer el espacio Dn en conjuntos que contienen todos los grafos de
contacto cuya estructura combinatoria es la misma; es decir, “agrupar” todos los grafos que
tienen las mismas aristas y vertices, pero con diferentes posiciones en el plano. A cada uno
de estos conjuntos los llamamos clases de contacto o estratos, denotados como C(G).
Podemos definir una clase de contacto como:
C(G) = {c ∈Dn : ||cj −ci|| = 2, ∀(i, j) ∈E(G)}
(3)
2.3.
Bordes de la envolvente convexa
Para calcular el per´ımetro de la envolvente de una configuraci´on, es necesario primero que
determinemos qu´e es la envolvente convexa exactamente. Consideramos que la envolvente
son las lineas que forman el per´ımetro exterior del conjunto de discos de la configuraci´on.
Concretamente, es la suma de las distancias entre los vertices que forman parte del per´ımetro
exterior, en orden ciclico, + 2π (la longitud de los arcos de los discos que forman parte del
per´ımetro).
Supongamos que el per´ımetro conecta una secuencia de discos identificados por los´ındices
v1, v2, . . . , vh. Definimos B como el conjunto de pares ordenados de ´ındices que conforman
este ciclo:

1.1. Lo que vas a lograr con este documento. La meta es que puedas hacer lo siguiente,
sin adivinar nada:
• Construir la matriz completa L(c) de restricciones lineales de primer orden.
• Calcular el funcional lineal de primera variacion de longitud Φ(δc, ω).

Conjuntos indice (combinatoria fija).
• E = conjunto de contactos disco–disco, cada elemento es un par no ordenado {i, j}.
• T = conjunto de tangencias curva–disco, cada elemento es una etiqueta α.
• S = conjunto de segmentos, cada segmento es un par ordenado α →β de tangencias.
• A = conjunto de arcos, cada arco es un triple (α →β, k, σa): extremos α, β sobre el
mismo disco Dk y un signo σa ∈{+1, −1}.
Datos geometricos minimos (esto SI es entrada). Para poder construir matrices y longitud,
necesitas:
• los centros c1, . . . , cN,
• para cada tangencia α ∈T: el disco k(α) ∈{1, . . . , N} y el punto pα ∈∂Dk(α),
• la lista S de segmentos α →β,
• la lista A de arcos (α →β, k, σa).
Convencion de rotacion 90◦. Usamos J(x, y) = (−y, x).
Normal y tangente en una tangencia (calculable desde c y p). Si α ∈T ocurre en el disco
k = k(α):
• normal unitario nα := pα −ck,
• tangente unitario tα := εαJnα con εα ∈{+1, −1}.
El signo εα lo fijas para que tα apunte en la direccion de recorrido de γ en α.

Chequeos inmediatos (si falla, la entrada esta mal).
• Para todo α ∈T: ∥pα −ck(α)∥= 1.
• Para todo α ∈T: ⟨nα, tα⟩= 0 y ∥tα∥= 1.
• Para todo {i, j} ∈E: ∥ci −cj∥= 2.
1.3. Variables de primer orden.
Variacion de centros (incognita). δc = (δc1, . . . , δcN) ∈R2N con δci ∈R2.
Variables auxiliares por tangencia (incognita). ω = (ωα)α∈T ∈R|T|.
Modelo cinematico (esto es una definicion operacional). El movimiento de cada punto de tan-
gencia se modela por δpα = δck(α) + ωαtα.
Comentario honesto: esta es la forma mas simple y util para convertir variacion de longitud
en una forma lineal en (δc, ω), y es la que se usa en el protocolo.
1.4. Bloque de contactos disco–disco: construccion de A(c).
Vector unitario de contacto. Para cada contacto {i, j} ∈E define uij := (ci −cj)/∥ci −cj∥.
Restriccion de primer orden. Como ∥ci−cj∥= 2 se mantiene constante en el estrato de contacto,
la derivada da ⟨uij, δci −δcj⟩= 0.
Construccion de la fila. A(c) tiene |E| filas y 2N columnas (bloques de tama˜no 2 por disco). La
fila de {i, j} tiene:
• bloque u⊤
ij en las columnas del disco i,
• bloque −u⊤
ij en las columnas del disco j,
• ceros en las demas columnas.
Espacio de rodadura. Roll(c) := ker A(c).
1.5. Bloques de tangencia: construccion de Tc(c) y Tω(c).
Ecuacion por tangencia. Para cada α ∈T imponemos ⟨tα, δck(α)⟩+ ωα = 0.
Aclaracion para tu duda:
• tα SI es calculable (desde pα y ck(α), mas el signo de orientacion).
• δc y ω NO se conocen a priori: son las incognitas del sistema lineal.
• La ecuacion no es un dato, es una restriccion.
Fila en Tc(c). La fila de Tc(c) asociada a α tiene un unico bloque no nulo:
• bloque t⊤
α en las columnas del disco k(α),
• ceros en los otros discos.
Fila en Tω(c). La fila de Tω(c) asociada a α tiene:
• un 1 en la columna de ωα,
• ceros en las demas columnas.
Conclusion. Con esta convencion Tω(c) = I.
1.6. Operador lineal completo de restricciones: L(c).
Definicion. L(c) es la matriz por bloques L(c) =

A(c)
0
Tc(c) Tω(c)

que actua sobre (δc, ω) ∈R2N ×
R|T|.
Significado de L(c). Las direcciones admisibles a primer orden son exactamente ker L(c) =
{(δc, ω) : L(c)(δc, ω) = 0}.
Eliminacion explicita de ω. Como Tω = I, la segunda linea da ω = −Tc(c)δc. Entonces, en este
modelo, toda δc ∈Roll(c) tiene un lift unico a ker L(c), dado por ω = −Tc(c)δc.
3
Correccion importante (esto arregla un error frecuente). No es correcto escribir un teorema de
primera variacion que dependa solo de c y contactos sin usar pα, tα y la descomposicion S, A.
La longitud del diagrama no depende solo del grafo de contacto; depende de la geometria del
trazo γ.
1.7. Longitud del diagrama y funcional de primera variacion Φ.
Longitud. Len(γ) es la suma de longitudes de:
• segmentos s ∈S (distancia entre extremos),
• arcos a ∈A (longitud angular sobre ∂Dk, con R = 1).
Definicion de Φ. El funcional de primera variacion es Φ(δc, ω) := D Len(γ)[δγ(δc, ω)] evaluado
en una direccion admisible (δc, ω) ∈ker L(c).
Criticidad en el estrato cs significa: Φ(δc, ω) = 0 para todo (δc, ω) ∈ker L(c).
1.8. Contribucion de un segmento y de un arco (formulas correctas).
Segmento s : α →β.
Datos del segmento. vs := pβ −pα, ℓs := ∥vs∥, ˆvs := vs/ℓs.
Primera variacion del segmento. D Len(s) = ⟨ˆvs, δpβ −δpα⟩.
Usando δpα = δck(α) + ωαtα: D Len(s) = ⟨ˆvs, δck(β) −δck(α)⟩+ ⟨ˆvs, ωβtβ −ωαtα⟩.
Arco a = (α →β, k, σa) sobre ∂Dk.
Primera variacion del arco. En este modelo: D Len(a) = σa(ωβ −ωα).
Nota de sanidad. Esta formula NO produce un termino directo en δc antes de eliminar ω. Si
luego sustituyes ω = −Tcδc, entonces si aparece dependencia en δc, pero eso es despues de la
eliminacion.
1.9. Ensamblaje mecanico de Φ: reglas de acumulacion.
Forma general. Φ(δc, ω) = g⊤
c δc + g⊤
ω ω para ciertos coeficientes gc ∈R2N y gω ∈R|T|.
Inicializacion. Partir con gc = 0 y gω = 0.
Regla por segmento s : α →β.
• En el bloque del disco k(α) sumar −ˆvs a gc.
• En el bloque del disco k(β) sumar +ˆvs a gc.
• Sumar −⟨ˆvs, tα⟩a gω[α].
• Sumar +⟨ˆvs, tβ⟩a gω[β].
Regla por arco a = (α →β, k, σa).
• Sumar −σa a gω[α].
• Sumar +σa a gω[β].
Resultado. Despues de procesar todas las piezas, Φ(δc, ω) = g⊤
c δc + g⊤
ω ω.
1.10. Test de criticidad en algebra lineal (dos metodos equivalentes).
Metodo 1: base de ker L(c).
(1) Calcula una base de ker L(c) y juntala como columnas de una matriz K.
(2) Calcula (gc, gω)⊤K.
(3) El diagrama es critico si y solo si (gc, gω)⊤K = 0.
Metodo 2: criterio de espacio fila. El diagrama es critico si y solo si existe λ tal que (gc, gω) =
L(c)⊤λ. Esto es resolver un sistema lineal para λ.

1. Un paquete completo de primera y segunda variacion para diagramas cs
1.1. Lo que vas a lograr con este documento. La meta es que puedas hacer lo siguiente,
sin adivinar nada:
• Construir la matriz completa L(c) de restricciones lineales de primer orden.
• Calcular el funcional lineal de primera variacion de longitud Φ(δc, ω).
• Decidir criticidad: el diagrama es critico si y solo si Φ se anula en todas las direcciones
admisibles.
• (Opcional) Calcular una segunda variacion (forma cuadratica) sobre direcciones admis-
ibles.
Lo importante: L(c) solo describe movimientos permitidos (primer orden). La longitud entra
por separado en Φ.
1.2. Datos del diagrama cs y convenciones.
Discos. Hay N discos unitarios D1, . . . , DN con centros ci ∈R2 y radio R = 1.
Piezas cs. El diagrama cs γ esta compuesto por:
• segmentos rectos (en el complemento de los discos) cuyos extremos son tangencias con
discos,
• arcos circulares sobre fronteras ∂Dk cuyos extremos son tangencias con el mismo disco.
Conjuntos indice (combinatoria fija).
• E = conjunto de contactos disco–disco, cada elemento es un par no ordenado {i, j}.
• T = conjunto de tangencias curva–disco, cada elemento es una etiqueta α.
• S = conjunto de segmentos, cada segmento es un par ordenado α →β de tangencias.
• A = conjunto de arcos, cada arco es un triple (α →β, k, σa): extremos α, β sobre el
mismo disco Dk y un signo σa ∈{+1, −1}.
Datos geometricos minimos (esto SI es entrada). Para poder construir matrices y longitud,
necesitas:
• los centros c1, . . . , cN,
• para cada tangencia α ∈T: el disco k(α) ∈{1, . . . , N} y el punto pα ∈∂Dk(α),
• la lista S de segmentos α →β,
• la lista A de arcos (α →β, k, σa).
Convencion de rotacion 90◦. Usamos J(x, y) = (−y, x).
Normal y tangente en una tangencia (calculable desde c y p). Si α ∈T ocurre en el disco
k = k(α):
• normal unitario nα := pα −ck,
• tangente unitario tα := εαJnα con εα ∈{+1, −1}.
El signo εα lo fijas para que tα apunte en la direccion de recorrido de γ en α.
Chequeos inmediatos (si falla, la entrada esta mal).
• Para todo α ∈T: ∥pα −ck(α)∥= 1.
• Para todo α ∈T: ⟨nα, tα⟩= 0 y ∥tα∥= 1.
• Para todo {i, j} ∈E: ∥ci −cj∥= 2.
1.3. Variables de primer orden.
Variacion de centros (incognita). δc = (δc1, . . . , δcN) ∈R2N con δci ∈R2.
Variables auxiliares por tangencia (incognita). ω = (ωα)α∈T ∈R|T|.
Modelo cinematico (esto es una definicion operacional). El movimiento de cada punto de tan-
gencia se modela por δpα = δck(α) + ωαtα.
Comentario honesto: esta es la forma mas simple y util para convertir variacion de longitud
en una forma lineal en (δc, ω), y es la que se usa en el protocolo.
1.4. Bloque de contactos disco–disco: construccion de A(c).
Vector unitario de contacto. Para cada contacto {i, j} ∈E define uij := (ci −cj)/∥ci −cj∥.
1
2
Restriccion de primer orden. Como ∥ci−cj∥= 2 se mantiene constante en el estrato de contacto,
la derivada da ⟨uij, δci −δcj⟩= 0.
Construccion de la fila. A(c) tiene |E| filas y 2N columnas (bloques de tama˜no 2 por disco). La
fila de {i, j} tiene:
• bloque u⊤
ij en las columnas del disco i,
• bloque −u⊤
ij en las columnas del disco j,
• ceros en las demas columnas.
Espacio de rodadura. Roll(c) := ker A(c).
1.5. Bloques de tangencia: construccion de Tc(c) y Tω(c).
Ecuacion por tangencia. Para cada α ∈T imponemos ⟨tα, δck(α)⟩+ ωα = 0.
Aclaracion para tu duda:
• tα SI es calculable (desde pα y ck(α), mas el signo de orientacion).
• δc y ω NO se conocen a priori: son las incognitas del sistema lineal.
• La ecuacion no es un dato, es una restriccion.
Fila en Tc(c). La fila de Tc(c) asociada a α tiene un unico bloque no nulo:
• bloque t⊤
α en las columnas del disco k(α),
• ceros en los otros discos.
Fila en Tω(c). La fila de Tω(c) asociada a α tiene:
• un 1 en la columna de ωα,
• ceros en las demas columnas.
Conclusion. Con esta convencion Tω(c) = I.
1.6. Operador lineal completo de restricciones: L(c).
Definicion. L(c) es la matriz por bloques L(c) =

A(c)
0
Tc(c) Tω(c)

que actua sobre (δc, ω) ∈R2N ×
R|T|.
Significado de L(c). Las direcciones admisibles a primer orden son exactamente ker L(c) =
{(δc, ω) : L(c)(δc, ω) = 0}.
Eliminacion explicita de ω. Como Tω = I, la segunda linea da ω = −Tc(c)δc. Entonces, en este
modelo, toda δc ∈Roll(c) tiene un lift unico a ker L(c), dado por ω = −Tc(c)δc.
Correccion importante (esto arregla un error frecuente). No es correcto escribir un teorema de
primera variacion que dependa solo de c y contactos sin usar pα, tα y la descomposicion S, A.
La longitud del diagrama no depende solo del grafo de contacto; depende de la geometria del
trazo γ.
1.7. Longitud del diagrama y funcional de primera variacion Φ.
Longitud. Len(γ) es la suma de longitudes de:
• segmentos s ∈S (distancia entre extremos),
• arcos a ∈A (longitud angular sobre ∂Dk, con R = 1).
Definicion de Φ. El funcional de primera variacion es Φ(δc, ω) := D Len(γ)[δγ(δc, ω)] evaluado
en una direccion admisible (δc, ω) ∈ker L(c).
Criticidad en el estrato cs significa: Φ(δc, ω) = 0 para todo (δc, ω) ∈ker L(c).
1.8. Contribucion de un segmento y de un arco (formulas correctas).
Segmento s : α →β.
Datos del segmento. vs := pβ −pα, ℓs := ∥vs∥, ˆvs := vs/ℓs.
Primera variacion del segmento. D Len(s) = ⟨ˆvs, δpβ −δpα⟩.
Usando δpα = δck(α) + ωαtα: D Len(s) = ⟨ˆvs, δck(β) −δck(α)⟩+ ⟨ˆvs, ωβtβ −ωαtα⟩.
Arco a = (α →β, k, σa) sobre ∂Dk.
Primera variacion del arco. En este modelo: D Len(a) = σa(ωβ −ωα).

Nota de sanidad. Esta formula NO produce un termino directo en δc antes de eliminar ω. Si
luego sustituyes ω = −Tcδc, entonces si aparece dependencia en δc, pero eso es despues de la
eliminacion.
1.9. Ensamblaje mecanico de Φ: reglas de acumulacion.
Forma general. Φ(δc, ω) = g⊤
c δc + g⊤
ω ω para ciertos coeficientes gc ∈R2N y gω ∈R|T|.
Inicializacion. Partir con gc = 0 y gω = 0.
Regla por segmento s : α →β.
• En el bloque del disco k(α) sumar −ˆvs a gc.
• En el bloque del disco k(β) sumar +ˆvs a gc.
• Sumar −⟨ˆvs, tα⟩a gω[α].
• Sumar +⟨ˆvs, tβ⟩a gω[β].
Regla por arco a = (α →β, k, σa).
• Sumar −σa a gω[α].
• Sumar +σa a gω[β].
Resultado. Despues de procesar todas las piezas, Φ(δc, ω) = g⊤
c δc + g⊤
ω ω.
1.10. Test de criticidad en algebra lineal (dos metodos equivalentes).
Metodo 1: base de ker L(c).
(1) Calcula una base de ker L(c) y juntala como columnas de una matriz K.
(2) Calcula (gc, gω)⊤K.
(3) El diagrama es critico si y solo si (gc, gω)⊤K = 0.
Metodo 2: criterio de espacio fila. El diagrama es critico si y solo si existe λ tal que (gc, gω) =
L(c)⊤λ. Esto es resolver un sistema lineal para λ.
Explicacion para abuela (sin perder verdad). L(c) dice que movimientos pequenos estan per-
mitidos sin romper contactos ni tangencias. Φ dice si esos movimientos pequenos hacen que la
curva se alargue o se acorte al primer orden. Critico significa: ningun movimiento permitido
cambia la longitud al primer orden.
1.11. Segunda variacion: version util para pregrado. Aqui hay una forma correcta y
ejecutable de segunda variacion, sin afirmar cosas falsas.
Idea. Primero construyes una forma cuadratica Qamb(δc, ω) (segunda variacion en el espacio
extendido). Luego la restringes a (δc, ω) ∈ker L(c).
Segunda variacion de un segmento. Para un segmento s : α →β con vs = pβ −pα y ℓs = ∥vs∥,
la segunda variacion de la distancia euclidea (formula estandar) se escribe como:
D2 Len(s) = 1
ℓs ∥(I −ˆvsˆv⊤
s )(δpβ −δpα) ∥2 + ⟨ˆvs, δ2pβ −δ2pα⟩.
En un protocolo de pregrado, normalmente se usa la aproximacion consistente de primer
orden: se ignora δ2p y se trabaja con la parte cuadratica positiva:
Qs(δc, ω) := 1
ℓs ∥(I −ˆvsˆv⊤
s )(δpβ −δpα) ∥2.
Esto es una forma cuadratica explicita en (δc, ω) porque δp es lineal en (δc, ω).
Segunda variacion de un arco. En este modelo, D Len(a) = σa(ωβ −ωα) es lineal, por lo tanto
su segunda variacion en las variables (δc, ω) es cero: Qa(δc, ω) = 0.
Forma cuadratica total. Define Qamb(δc, ω) := P
s∈S Qs(δc, ω).
La segunda variacion reducida sobre el estrato cs es la restriccion: Qred := Qamb|ker L(c).
Comentario honesto. Esta segunda variacion capta de manera limpia la curvatura de la parte de
segmentos y es suficiente para tests de estabilidad linealizados en muchos ejemplos. Si quieres
la formula completa con δ2p, hay que fijar un modelo de segundo orden del movimiento de
puntos de tangencia; eso es mas avanzado.
